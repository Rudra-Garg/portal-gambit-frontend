# Basic React Project

## Project Overview
This is a basic React project template to help you get started with building a React application. It includes essential configurations and dependencies to set up a React development environment.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn (v1.22 or higher)

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```
This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
The production-ready files will be in the `build` directory.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `App.js`: Main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `public/`: Static files and the HTML template.

## Available Scripts
- `npm start` / `yarn start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` / `yarn build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm test` / `yarn test`: Runs the test suite.
- `npm run eject` / `yarn eject`: Ejects the configuration (use with caution).
